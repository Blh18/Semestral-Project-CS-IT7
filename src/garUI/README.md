This is a semester project in Computer Science at Aalborg University.

## Getting started
This guide will show you how to successfully install and run this project. This is the second part of the
project - the frontend app that connects to the running server and provides you with working UI that can 
be easily used to test the introduced algorithm.

You can check your version by running `node --version` or `mongod --version` respectively. 

*Remember that you need to have the server part of this project up and running to be able to use this UI.*

### Installing dependencies
